import numpy as np

# Generate larger dataset
generator = DatasetGenerator()
generator.generate_game_data(num_games=10000)
generator.save_dataset('custom_dataset.csv')

# Train with custom settings
trainer = AITrainer()
# ... custom training code
"
```

### Extending the AI

```python
# Create custom AI implementation
from ai_player import HybridAI

class CustomAI(HybridAI):
    def get_move(self, game, player):
        # Custom decision logic
        return super().get_move(game, player)
```
